# Tkinter & CustomTkinter Examples

This repository contains examples of **Tkinter** and **CustomTkinter** widgets and their functionalities. It provides a quick overview of how to use different components to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. Whether you're new to these libraries or looking for practical code snippets, this repository serves as a helpful resource.

## Overview

The examples are organized into two main sections:
- **CustomTkinter**: A modern, customizable version of Tkinter with enhanced features and style options.
- **Tkinter**: The traditional Tkinter examples showing how to work with core components.

### CustomTkinter Examples
The `CustomTkinter` folder includes various examples demonstrating the usage of enhanced widgets and features:
- **CTKBackgounds_pictures.py**: Example showing how to set and manage background images.
- **CTKComboBox.py**: Custom combo box widget.
- **CTKScrollBar.py**: Demonstrates custom scrollbars.
- **CTKSlider.py**: Example of a modern, customizable slider.
- **CTKSwitch.py**: Toggle switch widget.
- More examples of other CustomTkinter widgets like `CTKTabview`, `CTKOptionMenu`, and more.

### Tkinter Examples
The `Tkinter` folder covers traditional Tkinter widgets and components:
- **botones.py**: Demonstrates button creation and styling.
- **colores_disponibles.py**: Example of available color options in Tkinter.
- **grid.py**: Shows how to work with Tkinter's grid layout system.
- **messagebox.py**: Example using message boxes for alerts and prompts.
- Other examples include `entry.py`, `label_frame.py`, `frame.py`, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You'll also need to install the `customtkinter` library for the CustomTkinter examples.


To install CustomTkinter, run:
```bash
pip install customtkinter
```

### Running the Examples
To run any of the examples, simply navigate to the folder and execute the desired Python file. For example:
```bash
python CustomTkinter/CTKComboBox.py
```
or
```bash
python Tkinter/botones.py
```

Each script is self-contained and provides a practical demonstration of one or more widgets.
